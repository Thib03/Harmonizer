# Harmonizer

## Server

In order to run the server, you have to have python 3 available, as well as the `python-osc`, `flask`, `flask_socketio` modules. It can be installed with `pip`. Once installed, step into the server and run the test patch with `python osc.py` to send out generate random chords over OSC.

The web server can be launched with `python server.py`. If the console doesn't print any error messages, you can now open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and hopefully you will see the correct webpage.
