# Harmonizer



## Server

In order to run the server, you have to have python 3 available, as well as the `python-osc` module. It can be installed running `pip install python-osc`. Make sure to use pip3 if you are using python 3. Once installed, step into the server and run the test patch with `python3 osc.py`
